Assessment Work Details. 
Thanks for giving me this opportunity to do this exercise. I mentioned done in the section I completed. While developing, I am facing one issue while calling the API call, I am getting a CORS error. The API call is always failing, and BE not returning data. Then I managed to get the API by disabling security options in Chrome. If the CORS error happening, Please run the below command in the terminal, chrome browser will open from the terminal - that's the Mac terminal command. Access the page from the browser opened from the terminal. If you will make a video call, I will show you a demo from my laptop. 

open -na Google\ Chrome --args --user-data-dir=/tmp/temporary-chrome-profile-dir --disable-web-security - Run this command from the terminal in Mac Laptop

I upload the project in Firebase CLI also. can you please open the link in incognito window. No idea, it's showing firebase setting in the normal chrome window. Also can you please trigger through command mentioned above in the Mac Laptop. Otherwise BE API call is returning CORS error.
